# Automatic-Classification-of-Potential-Mineral-Reserve
In this project, we will use the proper Deep Learning techniques and many sources of geological data to analyse and categorise the mineral prospectivity of a study area. 
A multilayer network, especially convolutional neural networks, which have drawn increased attention due to their distinct characteristics, is typically used to collect abstract features.
